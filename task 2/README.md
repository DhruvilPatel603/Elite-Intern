# Task 2 - Deep Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning model for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The model was built using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Model Architecture
- Input: Flattened 28x28 images
- Dense Layer: 128 units, ReLU
- Output Layer: 10 units, Softmax

## Output
- Training and validation accuracy plots
- Saved model (optional)
- `accuracy_plot.png`

## How to Run
```bash
python mnist_cnn.py
